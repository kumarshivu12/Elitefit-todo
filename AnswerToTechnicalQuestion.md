**Q4 -If you had more time, what additional features or improvements would you consider adding to the task management application?** 

Certainly! If I had more time to enhance a task management application, here are some features and improvements I'd consider:

1.  **User Authentication (Login/Signup):** Implementing a secure login/signup system would allow users to have personalized accounts. This way, each user can have their own space to store and manage their tasks privately.
    
2.  **Date and Time-Based Filtering:** Adding advanced filtering options based on dates and times. Users could sort and view tasks based on deadlines, due dates, or scheduled times, providing a more organized and time-sensitive approach to managing their tasks.
    
3.  **Priority Levels and Labels:** Providing the ability to assign priority levels or labels (e.g., high, medium, low) to tasks can help users prioritize their workload more effectively.
4.  **Notifications:** Offering users the flexibility to customize their task views and receive customizable notifications (e.g., reminders, alerts for approaching deadlines) can enhance user experience and keep them on track with their tasks.   

These additions aim to make the task management application more comprehensive, user-centric, and adaptable to different work styles and preferences.
